## Code Description

This code is a C# program that allows you to move data from one Elasticsearch cluster to another. It reads indices from a source Elasticsearch cluster, creates a Dockerfile with commands to transfer the data, and writes the Elasticsearch request to a file.

The code performs the following steps:

1.  Define the source and target Elasticsearch addresses.
2.  Set up the necessary paths and file names for the program to work.
3.  Delete any existing files if they exist.
4.  Use an HTTP client to fetch the indices from the source Elasticsearch cluster.
5.  Write the fetched indices to a file named "elastic.txt".
6.  Read the content of the "elastic.txt" file.
7.  Define a regular expression pattern to extract specific information from the content.
8.  Use the regular expression pattern to find matches in the content.
9.  For each match found, create an Elasticsearch request using the `CreateRequest` method.
10.  Write each request to a file named "elasticRequest.txt".
11.  Create a Dockerfile with the commands from the "elasticRequest.txt" file using the `CreateDockerFile` method.
12.  Execute the program.

## Running the Code

To run this code, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository or download the code files.
2.  Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
3.  Replace the placeholders `your elastic source address` and `your elastic destination address` in the code with the appropriate Elasticsearch addresses.
4.  Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
5.  Run the program.
6.  After execution, you will have the "elastic.txt" file containing the fetched indices and the "elasticRequest.txt" file with the Elasticsearch requests.
7.  A Dockerfile will also be created with the commands from the "elasticRequest.txt" file.

Make sure you have a working internet connection and valid Elasticsearch addresses to run the code successfully.
